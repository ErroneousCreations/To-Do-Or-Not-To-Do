Todoornottodo is the perfect planning and to do list software for any student/worker who might need it to help them plan their day! Get it today for the super low low price of free!

# Features
With custom backgrounds, 3 priority levels, custom due dates, to do list sorting, highly "advanced" drag-and-drop functionality, several different task views to organise your tasks better, including an Upcoming list, and a Trello-board-like view with three columns for To do, Doing and Done, Todoornottodo is the coolest open-source and free to-do list application!!

Todoornottodo is currently in development and is nowhere near complete. So if you want to help please open a pr or something.

Also Todoornottodo is built with the Unity engine. Kinda odd but don't complain. Might convert it to a website later on with electron or something.
