# Features
With custom backgrounds, priotiy, deadlines, sorting, cool drag and drop, and very organisational stuff, Todoornottodo is the coolest open source and free to do application!!

Todoornottodo is currently in development and is nowhere near complete. So if you want to help please open a pr or something.

Also Todoornottodo is built with the Unity engine. Kinda odd but don't complain. Might convert it to a website later on with electron or something.
